In many areas, especially rural and underserved regions, pregnant women do not always receive timely medical care because high-risk pregnancies are difficult to identify early. 
The Maternal Health Risk Predictor is designed to help address this problem by offering a simple digital tool that supports early risk identification.
The system works through an easy-to-use web application where basic health details such as age, blood pressure, blood sugar level, body temperature, and heart rate can be entered.
Based on this information, the system provides a clear risk indication—low, medium, or high—helping healthcare workers decide when extra care or follow-up is needed.
The application is lightweight and does not require complex infrastructure, making it suitable for use in primary health centers and community outreach programs. 
While the current version uses simple logic to assess risk, it can be upgraded in the future to include machine learning models trained on real maternal health data.
Overall, the Maternal Health Risk Predictor aims to support healthcare workers in making faster and better-informed decisions
  contributing to safer pregnancies and healthier outcomes for both mothers and newborns.
