#Maternal Health Risk Predictor
About the Project
The Maternal Health Risk Predictor is a simple web application that shows how a frontend (web page) can communicate with a backend (Python program). The project helps users understand basic full-stack development concepts using a healthcare example.
This project is meant for learning, mini projects, and hackathon demos.
What This Project Does

A web page has a Predict button

When clicked, it sends a request to the backend

The backend processes the request

A maternal health risk result is shown on the screen

(No database or machine learning is required in this version.)
